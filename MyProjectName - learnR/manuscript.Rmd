# Introduction

Your introduction is going to include citations. You can include one citation [@lapointe2018] or several citations [@lapointe2018; @vlisides2019].

## Use of This Template
Authors may use this Microsoft (MS) Word template by employing the relevant styles from the Styles and Formatting list (which is accessed from the Styles group in the Home ribbon). To view which style is being used in any part of this document, place the cursor on the line and look in the style list Figure \@ref(fig:figure1))


```{r figure1, fig.cap = "MS Word 2010 Home ribbon. Red arrow indicates where to access Styles window.", fig.asp=2550/3300, fig.height=6.5}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure1.png")
```


# Results

There was a significant effect of "Group" on the average test score `r describe.aov(model, "Group")`. Descriptive statistics were run and are shown in Table \@ref(tab:tbl-demo) below

```{r tab.id="tbl-demo", tab.cap="Descriptives"}
tbl.demo
```

A plot is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:myFigure1)

```{r myFigure1, fig.cap = "Caption for my Figure", fig.asp=2550/3300, fig.height=6.5}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plot1.png")
```
Its common to want to use "landscape" pages in order to fit a larger image. Below I show an example 


<!---BLOCK_LANDSCAPE_START--->

```{r fig.id="CohMeanAllTasks", fig.cap="Changes in Coherence over all Tasks in L-DLPFC/R-DLPFC. Significant group differences were noted in the Rest and 2-Back tasks", fig.width=7.4, fig.asp=2250/3300}
# aspect ratio must be 0.7705882352941176
knitr::include_graphics("images/CohMean_AllTasks.png")
```
<!---BLOCK_LANDSCAPE_STOP--->

# Appendix

Below I show some other common tricks you can accomplish in RMarkdown. You can view the [RMarkdown cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for more information



Text formatting 
------------------------------------------------------------

*italic*  or _italic_
**bold**   __bold__
`code`
superscript^2^ and subscript~2~

Headings
------------------------------------------------------------

# 1st Level Header

## 2nd Level Header

### 3rd Level Header

Lists
------------------------------------------------------------

*   Bulleted list item 1

*   Item 2

    * Item 2a

    * Item 2b

1.  Numbered Item 1. The numbers are incremented automatically in the output.
    +   Sub-item 1A
2.  Numbered Item 2
    +   Sub-item 2A
    +   Sub-item 2B
1.  Numbered list item 1

## Random Symbols I can use

You can render emojis in RMarkdown. Here are some examples.

‚úÖ Correct/Checkmark `r officer::run_linebreak()` ‚ùå Incorrect sign `r officer::run_linebreak()` üß† Brain `r officer::run_linebreak()` üìö Books `r officer::run_linebreak()` ‚àµ == because `r officer::run_linebreak()`
